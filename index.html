              The story of a young boy from Pallet Town, journeying to become the greatest Pokemon Master
              ever - we follow the adventures of Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu as they travel around
              the Pokemon world trying to become the best team they possibly can become. Joining
              Ash are several friends, including an aspiring Pokemon Breeder and the former Pewter
              City Gym Leader, Brock, and Pokemon Coordinator Dawn, who longs to be as talented
              a Pokemon Coordinator as her mother. Ash previously traveled with Misty, the current
              Cerulean City Gym Leader; May, another Pokemon Coordinator, and Max, the children
              of the Petalburg City Gym Leader; and Tracey, a Pokemon Watcher who currently
              assists Professor Oak in Pallet Town.
              <div class = "padding-top-20"></div>
              <img src = "./img/home/home2.jpg" class = "pull-right img-responsive" height="250" width="200"/>
              Ash begins his journey in the Kanto region. He receives his beginning Pokemon,
              Pikachu, from Professor Oak, the region's leading authority on Pokemon research.
              After collecting eight Badges from the Kanto region, Ash enters the Pokemon League
              at the Indigo Plateau and places into the Top 16. Ash and his friends then travel
              to the Orange Islands, where Ash becomes the region's Champion. After this they
              travel to the Johto Region, where Ash collects another eight badges and places
              in the Top 8 at the Silver Conference; Ash repeats these accomplishments in the
              Hoenn region. The group revisits the Kanto region so that Ash can challenge the
              Battle Frontier; after defeating the seven Frontier Brains, Ash becomes the
              Champion of the Battle Frontier as well. Currently, Ash and his friends are
              in the Sinnoh Region.

              <img src = "./img/home/home3.png" class = "pull-right img-responsive" height="250" width="200"/>
              However, not everything is fun and games for Ash and his friends, as each
              of them maintain rivalries with many individuals. Throughout all of the
              regions, Ash maintains a rivalry with his childhood, hometown counterpart
              Gary Oak. Other rivalries include Ritchie in the Kanto Region, Casey in
              the Johto Region, Harrison at the Silver Conference, Morrison at the
              Ever Grande Conference and Paul in the Sinnoh Region. May maintains a
              rivalry with two Pokemon Coordinators: Drew and Harley. Dawn also
              maintains friendlier rivalries with Pokemon Coordinators Zoey and
              Kenny.

              <img src = "./img/home/home4.png" class = "pull-right img-responsive" height="250" width="200"/>
              Additionally, Ash and his friends continuously encounter three comically
              bumbling agents from Team Rocket: Jessie, James and Meowth, who follow
              Ash across every region in the Pokemon World, attempting to capture his
              Pikachu to present to their boss: Giovanni, the leader of Team Rocket
              and the former Viridian City Gym Leader. Other Rocket agents revealed
              while the series explored the Kanto, Orange Islands and Johto regions
              include Butch, Cassidy, Mondo, Jessie's mother Miyamoto, Giovanni's
              mother Madame Boss, Attila, Hun, Professor Sebastian, Tyson, Domino,
              Wendy, Annie and Oakley. In the Hoenn Region, Ash encounters Tabitha's
              Team Magma and Shelly's Team Aqua; in the Sinnoh Region, Ash also fights
              against bounty huntress J and Cyrus's Team Galactic, including agents Mars,
              Jupiter and Saturn.

                      to release the magnetism that builds up in their bodies, due to the strong magnetic
                      forces emitted from the mountains. Recently, their “battle arena” (a deep crater) has
                      become filled with water. Ash, Dawn, Brock, Officer Jenny and Katsuzou have to find out
                      why the crater is full of water, and a way to drain it, so Magnezone and Metagross can
                      battle in peace away from the city.

                      but was later added by the iTunes release to distinguish it from the previous season.
